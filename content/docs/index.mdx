Our project is about an autonomous AI-Agent that utilizes LLMs to orchestrate security tools, conduct deep reconnaissance, and automate the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities in a controlled and professional manner.

with Fully AI automate reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and reporting. This establishing a continuous, adaptive testing architecture capable of simulating real threat actor behaviors.

Z2E-Agent redefines efficiency in security testing by automating repetitive phases such as enumeration, scanning, verification, and exploitation while maintaining precision through data-driven decision models.

## Core Features

- **AI Integration:** Embed artificial intelligence for pattern recognition in vulnerabilities and exploit generation.
- **Full Automation:** Build an end-to-end pipeline from reconnaissance to exploitation with minimal human input.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports including attack paths, PoCs, remediation insights.
