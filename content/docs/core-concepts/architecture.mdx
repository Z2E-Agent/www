## System Architecture

Z2E is built on a modular, layered architecture designed for flexibility and scalability.

---

### 1. Reconnaissance Layer (AI-Assisted)

Integrates multi-source OSINT modules:

- Passive DNS mapping
- Shodan / Censys API integration
- GitHub leak detection
- Threat intel feed correlation
- Exposure & asset mapping

---

### 2. Attack Surface Mapper

Identifies technology stacks via header analysis & content signatures:

- Protocol fingerprinting
- Dependency graphing for potential vulnerable packages
- ML-based prioritization scoring for high-risk endpoints

---

### 3. Vulnerability Verification Engine

Cross-references findings against:

- NVD CVEs + ExploitDB entries
- Sandbox payload simulation for exploit feasibility validation

Outputs statistical confidence levels per finding.

---

### 4. Exploitation Core (AI-Controlled)

Adaptive execution engine supporting validated payloads via scope-defined constraints:

- IDS/IPS evasion logic
- Sandboxed impact simulation
- Automated bypass strategies

---

### 5. Post-exploitation & Lateral Movement Simulator

Models enterprise-level compromise scenarios:

- Credential reuse mapping
- Domain escalation pathways
- Persistence validation mechanisms
