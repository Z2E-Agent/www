## AI Engine

Z2E's AI engine (MCP-Core) powers intelligent decision-making throughout the penetration testing lifecycle.

---

## Core Capabilities

### Pattern Recognition

The AI engine identifies vulnerability patterns across:

- Code structures and common anti-patterns
- Configuration weaknesses
- Historical exploit data correlation

### Adaptive Payload Generation

- Context-aware payload mutation
- Evasion technique selection
- Success probability scoring

### Risk Prioritization

- ML-based severity assessment
- Business impact correlation
- Attack path optimization

---

## MCP Protocol

The Machine Context Protocol (MCP) enables:

```yaml
mcp:
  version: "2.0"
  capabilities:
    - pattern_matching
    - payload_generation
    - risk_scoring
    - evasion_planning
  
  confidence:
    minimum_threshold: 0.75
    high_confidence: 0.90
```

## Training & Data

- Trained on curated vulnerability datasets
- Regular updates from threat intelligence feeds
- Feedback loop from successful exploitations
- Deterministic seeding for reproducibility
